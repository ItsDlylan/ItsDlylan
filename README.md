## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m a hands on my keyboard full-stack engineer who loves blending backend systems with clean frontend experiences.  
Right now I’m exploring how AI can augment developer workflows, speed up problem solving, and unlock new ways of building software.  

I’ve led engineering teams, shipped production apps in Laravel, React, and Node.js, and built APIs that power fintech and ecommerce platforms. I enjoy solving deep software problems, writing maintainable code, and collaborating with great people.
